                <h3> The Summer People </h3>
                <p>Manasquan's beach stretches one link along the Atlantic Ocean. This mile-long stretch of sand
                includes 17 beach openings. Because of its beach town nature, Manasquan's population nearly triples
                in the summer with people coming from all over, but mostly New York City, to rent houses
                or just stay for a weekend. Summertime at Manasquan Beach welcomes many different people, but it is
                mostly either families or groups of kids in their twenties. Families who spend summmers in Manasquan
                take advantage of lifeguraded beaches, the recreation camps offered, the kid-friendly events, the
                Thursday night beach fireworks and much more. The groups of kids in their twenties take advantage of the beach
                during the day and the Jersey Shore clubs and bars at night.</p>

            <h3> Manasquan Inlet </h3>
                <p> The Manasquan Inlet is widely known as one of the best surf spots along the East Coast.
                    It connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Manasquan River. While at the inlet, beachgoers
                    and surfers can see boats of all sizes coming into local marinas from the Atlantic Ocean.
                    Aside from acting as a connection between the ocean and the river, this inlet also
                    acts a separation of Monmouth and Ocean counties.</p>
