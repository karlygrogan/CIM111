    <p style="text-align:center;">Hello! Welcome to my Website. My name is Karly Grogan and I am currently a junior<br>
      at the University of Miami. I am in the Miami Business School, double majoring in Marketing and Management. <br> In the future, I would love to pursue a career in the marketing department of a fashion or beauty company in New York City.
      <br> A little more about me: I grew up in a small town on the Jersey Shore called Manasquan.
      In my free time, I love to go to the beach with family and friends.  </p>
